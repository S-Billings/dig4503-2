Objects have properties and functions, and have 3 possible relationships (is a, has a, none). "extends" gives an is a relationship. "properties" gives a has a relationship.  

class example {
    constructor(name){
        //can pass values through a constructor and set default properties. 

        this.name = name; //means whatever is passed in will become the property name for the class. 
    }

    speak() {
        //can access properties in the constructor. 
    }
}

JS XML (JSX)
    1. one root element (wrapping)
    2. all elements must close
    3. JS expressions are allowed, statements are not
        NOT ALLOWED: not equal, <, >, else, for(), while()
        ALLOWED: functions, variables (have values)
            let para = <p>Hi!</p>;
                instead...
            let value = 7;
            para = <p>{vlaue}</p>;

JSX + WebPack
    components are elements
        <example 1>
            ->new Example()
            -> Example.render()
    1. components take care of themselves
    2. all componenets can render        

    nmp run build // will make everything ready to drop on a server

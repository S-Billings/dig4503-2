Objects have properties and functions, and have 3 possible relationships (is a, has a, none). "extends" gives an is a relationship. "properties" gives a has a relationship.  

class example {
    constructor(name){
        //can pass values through a constructor and set default properties. 

        this.name = name; //means whatever is passed in will become the property name for the class. 
    }

    speak() {
        //can access properties in the constructor. 
    }
}
